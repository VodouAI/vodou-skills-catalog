# think-deep

Spin up a structured thinking session via `OI-Enhanced-Thinking`. Each option chooses how many iterative thoughts to generate before synthesizing.

## Stopping Point 1 — Depth

1. **Quick (3 thoughts)** — fast scan, no detours
2. **Thorough (8 thoughts)** — explore edges + edge cases, with intermediate stream
3. **Deep audit (15 thoughts)** — exhaustive analysis with severity ratings + remediation

The user's topic is templated as `{{TOPIC}}` — the agent should pull it from the question that triggered the skill.

## After the steps run

Synthesize the captured thoughts into a tight bullet summary. Lead with the strongest finding; flag anything risky inline.
